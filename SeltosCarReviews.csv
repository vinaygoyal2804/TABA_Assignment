Harsh Baranwal,"Seltos, in the price, is a very good car someone can get. Everything in it is pretty good but being a new company, the after-sales service that you'll get may leave you unsatisfied. Also, suspension in it is a bit on the harder side, it pumps back the vehicle and this is the only reason I've given it 4 stars because when we buy a car, with power, looks and features we tend to find comfort, which is a major reason of selecting a particular car. Yet the tyres used are too slim in such a heavy vehicle and after paying a huge amount of money. This doesn't give the feel of drive which you can get in some other vehicles in the same price range. So I'd say you can check other vehicles too if you're looking for a MUV at this range. Prolly Hector will be the best with head on head with Creta.","Dec20,2019",4,CarDekho.com

Nik,"I tried to ignore writing a review of the car. But the quality, performance and overall comfort of the car forced me to do so. I am here writing about Kia Seltos. Using this car for a bit now with decent 10000km on record. The car will not at all disappoint you in terms of pickup and driving comfort. The seats hold you so well and on top of it the response that you get from the steering. Really impressed. I have also driven another SUV's like Creta, Nissan kicks Mahindra XUV. But Kia has really made its presence and you will feel that in every term of the car. Drove the car on hilly terrain and the motor inside it gives you that punch even if driving on a steep upward hill. No power lag nothing. It's worth buying no second thoughts to look around.

I have been driving Seltos HTX Diesel for 1000 km now and the car never ceases to surprise. More airbags could have helped and the rear seat could have been a bit longer for supporting the knees. Great mileage and BS 6 compliance are a bonus. For the discerning buyers, this is a competitively priced offering.

Looks sturdy, has road presence and a differentiator when runs on the road, a masculine look which is attracting most of the young people.

Akshat Jain,"This is actually the best offering in the current price range. People have been cribbing about features, well then pay for it! You forget it's technically not an Indian company, so taxes are more! The range-topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both petrol and diesel comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. As is ABS and EBD! The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget what has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment. At 20.5 lakhs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get. Servicing might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either. The end result is that KIA was able to bring in a very trendy and highly-equipped package into the Indian market, and at a very good time too!","Dec09,2019",5,CarDekho.com

I can safely say that this is the best overall car in this price range presently. This car is a near-perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are amazing, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my Innova Crysta. Diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. The back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. Boot space has enough space for the luggage of five people for a short trip. I drove this vehicle on really ugly Bhokar-Nanded road of Maharashtra (bad would be a word for this road at present which I think) and I can assure you that , this vehicle has one of the best ride quality which can be easily comparable to my Innova Crysta in terms of ride quality. Seltos is breeze to drive. I drove the petrol GT line also for short distances, and it is also a great variant to own. You can go for either variant as per your needs and choice. Both variants are great. Diesel is giving me 17kmpl overall at present for 60% highway and 40% city drive with AC 100% on. I hope, mileage will definitely increase after the second service(oil change) to 19Kmpl overall. A smart air purifier with perfume diffuser is an added advantage. AC is powerful and works fantastically. In my opinion, At present, there is no competitor for Seltos, when it comes to the overall package.","Dec01,2019",5,CarDekho.com

The car has enough power to give you thrills on Indian roads and has good mileage in comparison to its competitors. Its interior is packed with loads and loads of features and has good quality materials used in it. The sound system is just phenomenal I just can't get words to describe the sound system.

The infotainment system is so good, have never seen this type of system in other cars which comes in it's rival and little costly then Kia Seltos. Amazing infotainment system with amazing interiors.

Raghhav Malhotra,Kia Seltos is a great car and its engine is pretty powerful and I love its interior. I love the way how its back is designed and I love its taillights. Overall it is a great car and if you have an option then you definitely buy it. Love the way it looks. The only thing I see is that it is more or less a Hyundai Creta with a better design and Kia's logo. But it is a very nice car and also its handling is way better than any other car in this segment. You can definitely think of buying this car.,"Nov19,2019",5,CarDekho.com

Suraj Yadav,"Getting into and out of the Seltos is easy and what is sure to impress is the sheer level of quality in the interior; material quality and fit-finish are up there with pricier European cars. The dashboard is neatly laid out and usefully places the infotainment system high up and in the driver?s line of sight. Top-spec Seltos? get slick 10.2-inch touchscreens, the instrument cluster is easy to read and there?s even head-up display. A powered driver?s seat, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, a 360-degree parking camera, and even an onboard air purifier are other features offered on the Seltos. Front seat comfort is good but the rear seat does lose some points for the somewhat lack of thigh support. While not the roomiest of SUVs for the price, the Seltos offers plenty of space and features like a retractable backrest and retractable sun visors also enhance the rear seat experience.  While we are yet to try out all engine-gearbox options on offer, we did come away very impressed with the 1.5 diesel-manual and the 1.4 turbo-petrol autos. The 115hp diesel is very refined and performance is pleasant. A slick gearbox and a well-weighted clutch also make it easy to live with. Those looking for a sporty drive will find a good match in the 140hp, 1.4 turbo-petrol. The engine is smooth, strong and very likable. Also good is the 7-speed dual-clutch auto that is responsive and quick to shift. What's missing are paddle shifters.  The Kia Seltos is easy to drive. The steering requires reasonable effort and weights up well enough at higher speeds. Ride comfort is good too with nice low-speed bump absorption and confident high-speed manners","Nov17,2019",5,CarDekho.com

I can't even write it's features as it's a very long list but its unique features are 1. Bose 8 premium sound speakers 2. An 8.00"" head-up display 3. A Bs 6 compliant engine 4. Massive 10.25 Inch HD screen 5. A 360degree view camera. 6. Ventilated and power-adjustable seats 7. A blind view monitor. And what do you want under 20 lac?","Aug30,2019",5,CarDekho.com
Amit Jain,"Kia Seltos - Kia the name itself is enough to buy the Kia Seltos. In India, it might be a new name but globally its a well-established brand, so if you like the car don't think twice about buying Kia Seltos. There are 3 engine option, two petrol and one diesel and let me tell you whichever engine you'll pick you won't be disappointed. I had driven all the 3 engines and my pick up will be 1.4 ltr turbocharged petrol beast with 140p.s and 250n.m of torque and yes its a petrol the most powerful petrol SUV in its class and you will get both manual and automatic option(dual-clutch transmission). It's a delight. I know there are two many varients but I'll make simple for you guys. If you have a budget constraint and you want a petrol engine then you can go for htk+ it will come around up to 12.50 lacks on road depending on your city, and you will get all the necessary as well as luxury features u need. Though it's a normal 1.5 ltr petrol, if you are not a keen driver and you generally drive in the city its a very good option. Now if you ask me about diesel it is also very refined and turbo. Let me tell you all engines are BS6. So whichever engine you will choose you wont be disappointed.","Aug30,2019",4,CarDekho.com

Xczxzcc,"One of the most futuristic-looking cars, in my opinion, it's better than MG Hector or the Tata Harrier, Seltos gives a very punchy performance and the power delivery is very linear you just have to press the gas pedal and the rpm meter goes right up to the 5000 rpm, mark it gives an excellent performance, hats off to Kia motors. The Kia Seltos is the 3rd car in India after Hyundai Venue and MG Hector to get a connected tech called UVO meaning your voice and has 37 features. The UVO app can be used to control functions like remote engine start/ stop, door lock/ unlock, voice based commands and remote vehicle status among others. Kia has partnered with Vodafone to provide connectivity solutions along with many other tech companies like MapMyIndia and LG. Move inside the cabin and you will be taken aback by the design and layout. There are a variety of trim options right from an all-black theme to dual tone and more. The overall layout remains the same with a cockpit inspired design. The highlight, of course, is the large horizontally placed 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system that's intuitive to operate. The system adjoins the instrument cluster having a 7-inch digital display and looks modern, not only the Seltos is feature-rich, but it's also mechanically rich. Kia has added a variety of engine and gearbox options in the Seltos to cater a wide audience and growing demand of the buyers. To be precise, there are 3 engine options and four gearbox options combined to form 16 variant options. The one we drove during our first-drive review was the 1.5-litre diesel engine with an automatic gearbox. Before talking about the driving experience, here's a brief idea about the engine options. There's a 1.5-litre petrol engine developing 115 PS and 144 Nm output mated to either a 6-speed manual or a CVT gearbox. There's the 1.5-litre diesel with 115 PS and 250 Nm output mated to a 6-speed manual and 6- speed automatic unit, the one which got to drive. And lastly, the talk of the town 1.4-litre turbo petrol producing 140 PS and 242 Nm and is mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed DCT. All the engines are BS-VI ready. There are 3 drive modes - Normal, Eco and Sport and three traction modes - Mud, Snow and Sand to choose from, however, there's no physical knob to easily opt between these modes. There's no all-wheel drive system either. Talking about the drive experience, the diesel engine had a minimal turbo lag with a linear delivery and a very good low-end torque. The auto gearbox responded well with the engine and it was not difficult doing three digit speeds even on narrow Goan roads. The flat-bottom steering not only felt good to hold but also had balanced feedback for city and highway driving. It was not difficult to take sharp turns, though it felt a bit heavier at times. The ride quality was fabulous and it felt like Kia had worked hard to tune suspension as per the Indian roads. We took the car through water clogged roads, broken patches and highway and the Seltos did not disappoint us. The NVH levels were refined and no diesel clutter or instant acceleration noise seeped inside the cabin. The braking was confident too, and heavy rains didn't affect the braking force much. In terms of mileage, Kia claims 16+ kilometres to a litre for both the petrol engines and 21 kmpl for the diesel engine with a manual gearbox.","Aug10,2019",5,CarDekho.com

Sukhjinder Singh,"Based on my onscreen review, one of the best SUV to hit the market with its maiden entry into the Indian market. As the images and video reveals it has everything that Creta lacks as far as exterior design is concerned especially the rear view. A big but well designed SUV Seltos touches deep to my heart with marvelous front, beating the MG Hector, heart touching rear beating the Hyundai Creta and the boot space, ground clearance, length, breadth, height, and power is almost same as that of XUV500, MG Hector and Tata Harrier. But it is the pricing that matters in the Indian market. Price it properly to avoid the undesired results as it happened in case of Jeep Compass. Trust me the Indians will compromise with safety features but not with design and pricing. Believe me, this SUV is going to rock the market with the sporty design but pricing that worries me. Don't forget what is happening to Jeep Compass as it is priced beyond the buyer's expectations. In the end best of luck to Kia, a sister company of Hyundai to compete not only with its brother Hyundai but also with all the SUVs currently available in the Indian market.","Jun26,2019",4,CarDekho.com
